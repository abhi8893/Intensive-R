Data file (data.csv) contains the consumptions of different types of food by 25 countries.
Overall it contains 9 features and 25 data points.
1. Perform k-medoid algorithm for the given dataset for K=3. Report the three medoids of the final clusters formed and the corresponding country name.                            [2]
2. Give the country names in each of the three clusters found above.           [2] 
3. Plot J vs K curve for the dataset for k=1 to 10 using K-medoid only.        [6] 
4. Comment on the plot and the nature of the distribution of the dataset.      [2] 
5. Perform hierarchical clustering on the dataset and report the dendogram.    [3] 
6. Cut the tree such that you get three clusters and compare your results with the k-medoids output with explanation.                                                       [5]
