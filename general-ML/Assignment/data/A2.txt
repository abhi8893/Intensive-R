Assignment 2

Use the data.csv file for two class two feature problem
1373 data points 
Seperate the first 100 data points from each of the classes (0 and 1) for testing and the remaining data points for training.

1. Report the mean and scatter of both the classes. [4]
2. Find the direction (v) which maximizes the separation of the classes using LDA. [2]
3. Project all  training data points onto v and create your own decision rule. Write as comment in your code about the decision criterion. In the overlapping region on the projected line you can randomly predict the classes. [8]
4. Predict the class of 200 test data points based on the criterion and report the accuracy with confusion matrix. [4]
5. Perform KNN on the projected data points for k=5 to predict the classes of the 200 test points. Report the accuracy with confusion matrix.[2]
